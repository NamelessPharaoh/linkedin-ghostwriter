*
* [2025-04-05 23:36:00] - Identified ModuleNotFoundError in linkedin_news_post/mcp_server.py.


## Decision

*
* The script run_linkedin_ghostwriter.py failed due to an import error, indicating a potential issue with Python's sys.path or the execution context.


## Rationale 

*
* Investigate the import mechanism and execution environment to resolve the error. This might involve adjusting how scripts are run or modifying import statements.


## Implementation Details

*
* [2025-04-06 00:50:58] - Decision: Investigate Composio error "Could not find a connection with app='linkedin' and entity='linkedin_mcp'". Rationale: Error prevents LinkedIn actions. Implementation: Fetch Composio documentation.
* [2025-04-06 00:50:58] - Decision: Confirmed project uses `composio_langchain`, requiring CLI-based connection setup (`composio add linkedin`). Rationale: Documentation and user example clarified the integration method. Implementation: Adjusted troubleshooting steps.
* [2025-04-06 00:50:58] - Decision: Implement a connection check in `run_app.py` instead of full OAuth automation. Rationale: Full automation not feasible; check guides user for manual CLI steps. Implementation: Modified `run_app.py` to use `ComposioToolSet().get_tools()` in a try-except block before starting `main.py`.
